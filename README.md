## Technical Implementation

### State Management

LyticSpend uses React Context API for global state management, with separate contexts for different concerns:

- Transactions and financial data
- Categories and payment methods
- User preferences (currency, theme)
- Budget settings

### Data Persistence

All data is stored in the browser's localStorage, allowing the app to function offline and persist data between sessions.

### Responsive Design

The app is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. It includes:

- Mobile-first design approach
- Touch-friendly UI elements
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes

### Dark Mode

Full dark mode support is implemented throughout the application, respecting user preferences and providing a comfortable viewing experience in low-light conditions.
